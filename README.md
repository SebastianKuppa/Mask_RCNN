# Mask_RCNN
This repository contains a CNN instance segmentation algorithm for images.
In order to execute the algorithm, you need an image in the input directory.
Afterwards you execute the mask_rcnn_images.py file with following example params:
--input ../input/test1.jpeg
The following image is a detection result with a detection trigger of 96.5%. Therefore you can see, that not all objects where detected.
